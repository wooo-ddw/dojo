## Reporting New Security Issues with the dojo


**We strongly encourage folks to report such security problems to our private security mailing list first,
before disclosing them in a public forum**.


```
All mail sent to this address that does not relate to security problems in the dojo source code will be ignored
```



The mailing address is: [dojo-security@dojotoolkit.org]
